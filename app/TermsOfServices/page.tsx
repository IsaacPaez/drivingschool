          There will not be an additional fee charged for picking up a student
          and returning to the point of starting, on our service area. A lesson
          consists of 110 minutes (a 10 minute break is taken in the middle of
          the lesson or at the end of the lesson for a break at the discretion
          of the Instructor. More than one lesson per appointment may be given.
          Once an appointment has been made, it must be cancelled or rescheduled
          48 hours in advance BY PHONE (no text or emails are accepted ) to
          avoid forfeit of the lesson or $90.00 rescheduling fee, this includes
          the first lesson, so even if student does not take the lesson, it must
          be paid for. Instructor will wait at the designated pick up location
          for a period of fifteen (15) minutes, if student cannot be reached,
          lesson is considered forfeited. If student is ill, a doctor's note is
          required to waive the fee, no exceptions. NO REFUNDS It is agreed that
          an owner, instructor, agent or employee of this school shall not give
          the impression that upon completion of the instruction that this
          school will guarantee the obtaining of a driver's license to operate a
          motor vehicle. This School will not refund any tuition or part of
          tuition since the school is ready, willing and able to fulfill its
          part of this contract. There will not be any refunds for any unused

          The School reserves the right to forfeit a lesson to anyone who drives
          recklessly on purpose endangering our safety and the safety of others.
          All questions must be directed to the office. Driving Instructors will
          refer you back to the office unless the question is about the
          student's lesson performance.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If Instructor is late picking up the student, the student will get the
          full length of the lesson (110 minutes) starting at arrival time;
          reason why Instructor might be late depends on traffic/weather
          conditions and/or distance of previous student's lesson. In case the
          full length of lesson is not taught by the instructor, inform the
          office immediately, complaints will not be accepted if not reported on
          the same day.

          driving test must be completed within 60 days. <br /> Safety is essential!

          If student does not have a learner's permit at the time of pickup, the
          lesson's full price must be paid. It is illegal to drive without a
          learner's permit or license, therefore the school will not to teach
          any student without a learner's permit. <br />

          student owes any fees to the school, there will be a fee of $50 fee
